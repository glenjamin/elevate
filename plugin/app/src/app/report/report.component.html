			StravistiX is an open-source project having sources hosted on GitHub. All features, bugs, and
			open-source contributions are managed from the <a href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/elevate/"
															  target="_blank">project repository</a>.
		</div>

			So ideally, please submit your bug or request <a
			href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/elevate/issues/new" target="_blank">here</a> to insert them in
			the dedicated development workflow.

			This is understandable. Even if it is not recommend, because out of workflow, you can submit your request
			from <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/dWZYVlsxRThoeBkE3" target="_blank">this google form</a>.
